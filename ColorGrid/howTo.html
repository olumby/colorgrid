		<h1>How to Play</h1>
		
		<p>The aim of the game is to always tap on the lightest color you can see.</p>
		
		<p>You start with 30 seconds on the clock, time is deducated for wrong choices and rewarded for correct ones. Each correct choice also gains points.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Easy mode</strong> gives you two options, <strong>hard mode</strong> gives you four options and <strong>harder mode</strong> gives you 6 options. Whilst the number of options increases only one option is lighter.</p>
